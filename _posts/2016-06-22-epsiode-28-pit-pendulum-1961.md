<h2>The Pit and the  Pendulum (1961)</h2>
The Pit and the Pendulum is notable for for being part of the classic Corman/Price series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations that was kicked off by The Fall of the House of Usher.

The movies were characterized by strong performances by Price, in his classic scenery chewing manner and absolutely lavish set design. The violence and sex of these productions mirrored the Hammer movies coming out of England around the same time.

(In a small aside, the path Andrew and I are taking leads us to Hammer pretty soon. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/thewatermethod">I'd love to hear some recommendations if you have any.</a>

You can see the very cool set paintings that are featured in the beginning of the film above. Also, the poster shows off the cool paintings from the climax of the film.

In our podcast episode, I talk briefly about her role in Curse of the Crimson Altar.[/caption]
