I think that <a title="James Whale IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001843/">James Whale</a> is the greatest English film director of the Golden Age of Horror. Â His only real peer is probably Fritz Lang, the German director who began making Hollywood films in the early 1940's.

James Whale is most famous for <em>Frankenstein</em> and <em>Bride of Frankenstein</em>, and rightly so. They are both incredibly pieces of horror film. It is fair to criticize Frankenstein, the first film, for failing to properly adapt Shelley's novel. I read the book in advance of seeing the picture and I was disappointed to see that the monster did not become literate and well-spoken - I found that aspect of the creature in Shelley's novel to be one of the most terrifying characteristics of the creature.

I have found that over time, I appreciate the simplicity of the film. Given only a little over an hour to tell a story, Shelley's novel was unfilmable as is. Noting these restrictions, <em>Frankenstein</em> can be viewed in a much more positive light.

<h3>Themes in James Whale's Filmmaking</h3>

<h4>The Influence of German Expressionism</h4> 

Although Whale was British and not German, and a bit younger than his German peers, many of his movies display the hallmarks of German Expressionism. The bizarre, unrealistic angles, long and menacing shadows and a general lack of realism. <em>Bride of Frankenstein</em> is one of the great expressionistic films of all time, existing as it does in the dream state between realities, with a leering, Orphic Dr Preterious guiding the audience into the underworld.

<h4>Issues of Class</h4>

Whale was preoccupied with issues of class throughout his work, especially in terms of the behavior of certain classes. His obsession with the small-mindedness of small-town folk, for example, echoes throughout every movie of his that I've seen. <em>The Invisible Man</em>, for example, stays at inn populated with a variety of ridiculous caricatures. In <em>The Old Dark House</em>, Charles Laughton plays a nouveau riche Welshman who rails against perceived slights against his dead wife by the upper classes.

<h4>Humor</h4>

<em>The Old Dark House</em> is equal parts comedy and Gothic. <em>Frankenstein</em>, <em>Bride</em>, and <em>The Invisible Man</em> all have strong comic relief elements. 

<h3>What sets Whale apart?</h3>

Whale, more than any other director I can think of, presents his movies as theater. His actors, many of whom he is reusing from him stage career, recur in his movies and deliver strong performances.
